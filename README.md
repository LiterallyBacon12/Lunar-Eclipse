„Äê - Message from Developers - „Äë
Hello, As you're reading this we kindly suggest you to use this multi tool at your own risk,
The supposed category "Multi Tool hack" is used at your own risk so once you commit something with this tool we aren't taking actions,
You're going to be at your own and we would be able to help, It's best to use other tools rather than this. You can use it and no one will stop you but beware, You're on your own.
```
üìö„Äç Welcome to Lunar Eclipse, Multi-Tool for discord and other things besides discord. This tool must be used responsibly, I will not take actions or help you once you do something. This was made purposely for fun & not meant to harm so please kindly use this at your risk.

‚ùóÔ∏è„Äç All scripts used in here are bunch of garbage trashed scripts for discord that hasn't been used for quite some times, All scripts have been revamped and updated and putted into a singular multi-tool that would have more features in the upcoming future.

üõ†„Äç Release date is not confirmed as 4 bunch of asshole contributed to the making of one Project so it may take quite a while as one will overlay and change something quite in the script and we don't get along so, It may take some times.

‚ú®Ô∏è„Äç As of it's release we will be trying to implement a key system for the free version that would last 15 hours, Why? Cause mostly we don't wanna copy the time that the Roblox Executors use so we decided to change it.
